# Migration Log: 2025-11-10

## Overview

Today marks the establishment of the ed-ai hub repository through migration of general AI-in-education materials from the ITS4LL project. This migration implements the hub-and-spoke architecture described in MIGRATION.md.

## What Was Migrated

### Infrastructure

- **Development Environment**: Generalized flake.nix configuration for documentation work (removed ITS-specific ML/AI packages)
- **Quarto Configuration**: Created hub-appropriate _quarto.yml with navigation for literature, funding, blog, and logs
- **Extensions**: Copied reusable highlight extension for syntax highlighting
- **Assets**: Migrated general CSS styles, citation formats, and AI-in-education diagrams

### Content

**Research Literature**:

- Created `research/literature/ai-in-education.qmd` with annotated bibliography covering:
  - AI in education meta-analyses and surveys
  - Prompt engineering research
  - Educational foundations (Bloom's 2 Sigma Problem)
  - General intelligent tutoring systems research

**Research Notes**:

- `research/notes/llm-tutoring-systems.md` - Framework for comparing local vs. cloud LLM tutoring approaches
- `research/notes/design-considerations.md` - Challenges in LLM tutoring system design (fairness, reliability, safety)
- `research/notes/academic-integrity.md` - Perspectives on AI and academic integrity

**Templates**:

- `research/templates/irb-protocol-template.md` - Generalized IRB protocol template for AI-in-education research

**Funding**:

- Migrated general funding strategy documents to `funding/strategies/`
- Copied Spencer Foundation opportunity information to `funding/opportunities/`

**Blog Posts**:

- Academic integrity considerations (general)
- LLM tutoring system design considerations (general)

### Bibliography

Consolidated three bibliography files from ITS4LL into single `references.bib`:

- Main references.bib (526 lines)
- assets/data/biblio.bib (18 lines)
- assets/data/references.bib (266 lines)

This provides a comprehensive, deduplicated bibliography for the hub.

## What Was NOT Migrated (Stays in ITS4LL)

- ITS-specific research documents (literature reviews focused on SLA, technical implementation plans)
- ITS-specific funding materials (grant proposals, specific project planning)
- Language learning-specific content (BIPED analysis, SLA research)
- Implementation code and experiments
- ITS collaboration documents (whitepaper, strategic roadmap)

These materials will form the basis of the **ed-ai-its** spoke repository when created.

## Design Decisions

1. **Bibliography**: Kept in hub only as single source of truth, spoke repositories will reference it
2. **Blog Structure**: Preserved blog/ directory for continuity and familiar navigation
3. **Private Resources**: Maintained _resources/ for working documents and collaboration materials
4. **Development Environment**: Simplified to focus on documentation (Quarto, R, Python) without ML/AI packages

## Next Steps

1. Create index files for each directory to improve navigation
2. Verify Quarto site builds successfully
3. Create spoke repositories (ed-ai-its, ed-ai-session-prep) inheriting this hub structure
4. Update MIGRATION.md with completion status
5. Commit and push to establish hub foundation

## Rationale

This migration supports the broader vision of AI-PRAXIS:

- **Modularity**: Hub provides shared resources, spokes develop specific projects
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Centralized literature and funding resources
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new spoke projects without duplicating foundational content
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for general AI-in-education knowledge
