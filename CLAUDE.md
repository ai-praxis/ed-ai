This file provides guidance for AI assistance with the ed-ai hub repository, which serves as the central knowledge base for AI interventions in higher education.

## Repository Purpose

This hub repository collects and organizes research, literature, and resources related to artificial intelligence applications in higher education. It serves as the foundation for specific project implementations developed in spoke repositories.

## Research Mission

**Core Question**: How can AI be thoughtfully integrated into higher education to enhance existing educational infrastructure while maintaining institutional agency, pedagogical rigor, and ethical responsibility?

**Key Principles**:

- **Enhancement over Replacement**: AI should empower rather than replace existing educational practices
- **Institutional Agency**: Institutions should control their AI tools and maintain alignment with their educational missions
- **Evidence-Based Design**: Interventions should be grounded in educational research and theory
- **Ethical Integration**: AI applications must prioritize student privacy, academic integrity, and equitable access

## Content Organization

### Research & Literature

Literature reviews and annotated bibliographies covering:

- AI in education (general applications and trends)
- Intelligent tutoring systems
- Large language models in educational contexts
- Educational technology and learning sciences
- AI ethics in education

### Research Notes

Working documents exploring:

- Design considerations for educational AI
- Academic integrity and AI
- Pedagogical frameworks for AI integration
- Case studies and emerging practices

### Funding Resources

- Funding strategies and planning frameworks
- Grant opportunities focused on AI in education
- Proposal templates and successful examples

### Templates

Reusable resources for research including:

- IRB protocol templates for AI-in-education research
- Evaluation frameworks
- Documentation standards

## Hub-and-Spoke Architecture

This repository serves as the **hub** for general AI-in-education knowledge. Specific projects are developed in **spoke repositories** that:

- Inherit the hub's foundational structure
- Reference hub literature and resources
- Focus on specific AI interventions or applications
- Contain project-specific implementation work under `./project/`

**Current Spokes**:

- `ed-ai-its`: Intelligent tutoring systems for language learning
- `ed-ai-session-prep`: AI-assisted preparation for tutoring sessions
- More in development...

## Research Approach

### Theoretical Foundations

Drawing from multiple disciplines:

- **Educational Theory**: Learning sciences, instructional design, pedagogical frameworks
- **Technology Integration**: Educational technology research, human-computer interaction
- **AI & Machine Learning**: Natural language processing, adaptive systems, AI ethics
- **Higher Education**: Institutional practices, student success research, academic support services

### Methodological Considerations

Research in this area typically involves:

- Mixed-methods approaches combining technical implementation with educational evaluation
- User studies with students, faculty, and support staff
- Iterative design and development processes
- Ethical review and institutional approval

### Documentation Standards

When working with this repository:

- Use clear, accessible language appropriate for interdisciplinary audiences
- Cite sources appropriately using the references.bib bibliography
- Follow Quarto markdown conventions for documentation
- Maintain consistent organization within established directory structure
- Add carriage returns between headers and body text, and between text and lists

## Collaboration

This hub supports collaboration across:

- Researchers from multiple disciplines
- Educational practitioners and instructional designers
- Students interested in educational technology
- Academic support service providers

When documenting research or adding resources, consider how they might be useful to these diverse stakeholders.

## Technical Environment

This repository uses:

- **Nix flakes** for reproducible development environments
- **Quarto** for documentation and website generation
- **R and Python** for data analysis and visualization
- **Git** for version control and collaboration

## AI Assistance Guidelines

When using AI tools (like Claude Code) with this repository:

- Prioritize accuracy and evidence-based claims over speculation
- Maintain academic rigor in documentation and citations
- Consider ethical implications of proposed AI interventions
- Think critically about how interventions enhance rather than replace educational practices
- Use interdisciplinary perspectives when appropriate
- Keep documentation clear and accessible to diverse audiences

## Expected Outcomes

This hub should facilitate:

- Comprehensive understanding of AI applications in higher education
- Evidence-based design of new AI interventions
- Effective collaboration across projects and disciplines
- Knowledge sharing and documentation of best practices
- Ethical, effective, and sustainable AI integration in educational contexts
