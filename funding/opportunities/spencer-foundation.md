[https://www.spencer.org/initiative-on-ai-and-education](https://www.spencer.org/initiative-on-ai-and-education)

## Initiative Overview

Launched in Spring 2024, the Spencer Foundation's Initiative on AI and Education represents a comprehensive effort to explore AI's potential in education while prioritizing equity and addressing systemic educational challenges. The initiative aims to "re-envision possibilities for education and learning across the lifespan."

## Core Activities

### 1. Advancing Research in Four Key Areas

**AI and Learning**

How can AI tools be more culturally relevant, and how can we leverage recent advances in learning sciences to build more sophisticated tools for classrooms that are in line with what we know from cognitive science and learning sciences to better serve all students? In PK-12 this might include tool and program development, but also studying existing products, and the pedagogical issues around teaching and learning with AI tools. In higher education, this might include learning products but also supports for student services, course enrollment and management, and advising supports. This may also take the form of historical or philosophical inquiry into the theories of learning of AI and how these theories could be adapted to align with culturally relevant pedagogy and other advances in the learning sciences. Finally, in what ways might AI technologies be leveraged outside of school to enable learning for children and adults?

**AI Policy**

Research examining how AI policies are implemented in educational contexts, their effectiveness, and impacts on diverse student populations.

**AI Ethics and Justice**

Investigation of ethical considerations and justice implications of AI deployment in educational settings, with particular attention to equity and access issues.

**Transforming Educational Research**

Exploration of how AI can enhance educational research methodologies and practices.

### 2. Cultivating Collaborations

- Connecting researchers, technology industry professionals, policymakers, and educational practitioners
- Bridging gaps between the AI sector and educational institutions
- Fostering interdisciplinary partnerships for educational innovation

### 3. Enriching Public Discourse

- Strengthening scientific insights about AI applications in education
- Deepening equity perspectives in AI education discussions
- Balancing analysis of opportunities and risks associated with AI technologies

## Funding Approach

The initiative integrates AI-focused research through Spencer's existing grant programs:

- **Vision Grant Program**: Supporting innovative, large-scale research projects
- **Racial Equity Program**: Centering equity in AI education research
- **Small/Large Research Grants**: Funding projects across various scales
- **Research-Practice Partnership Program**: Connecting academic research with educational practice

## Key Research Priorities

- Development of culturally relevant AI educational tools
- Analysis of AI policy implementation in educational contexts
- Ethical considerations in AI deployment for learning
- Impact assessment on underserved and marginalized communities
- Methodological innovations in educational research using AI
- Cross-sector collaboration between academia, industry, and education

## Overarching Goal

The initiative seeks to provide "evidence-based guidance that centers the needs of young people," ensuring AI contributes positively to student learning and thriving while addressing systemic educational inequities.

### Strategic Recommendations for Grant Application

#### 1. Frame as Methodological Innovation

**Positioning**: "Advancing AI in Education through Pedagogically-Grounded Local Deployment"

**Key Narrative**: Address Spencer's call for methodological innovation by demonstrating how local LLM deployment with fine-tuning and RAG can maintain educational effectiveness while ensuring privacy and institutional control.

#### 2. Emphasize Equity Dimensions

**Privacy as Equity**:

- Local deployment protects student data from commercial exploitation
- Institutional control ensures culturally appropriate content
- Multilingual capabilities (140+ languages via Gemma 3) serve diverse populations

**Access Considerations**:

- Open-source framework enables broad adoption
- Cost-effective local deployment vs. subscription models
- Customizable for different institutional contexts

#### 3. Strengthen Learning Sciences Foundation

**Theoretical Grounding**:

- SLA theory integration with communicative language teaching
- Task-based learning principles in AI tutoring design
- Cognitive load theory application in adaptive instruction

**Evidence-Based Approach**:

- Mixed-methods evaluation combining computational metrics with learning outcomes
- Comparative analysis with existing language learning tools
- Longitudinal impact assessment on learner proficiency

#### 4. Develop Cross-Sector Collaboration Component

**Academic-Industry Partnership**:

- Collaboration with Ollama/Gemma development teams
- Integration with existing educational technology ecosystems
- Open-source contributions to AI education community

**Practitioner Integration**:

- Language educator feedback in system design
- Classroom pilot studies with K-12 and higher education
- Professional development for AI-enhanced language instruction

#### 5. Address Spencer's Specific Research Questions

**Primary Question Response**: "How can AI tools be more culturally relevant?"

- Cultural context integration through RAG-enhanced curriculum materials
- Multilingual fine-tuning with authentic language use examples
- Community-responsive content adaptation

**Pedagogical Innovation**: "Leverage learning sciences for sophisticated classroom tools"

- Adaptive instruction based on SLA progression stages
- Formative assessment integration with AI feedback
- Personalized learning pathways aligned with proficiency frameworks

#### 6. Methodological Contributions to Field

**Technical Innovation**:

- Framework for educational LLM fine-tuning evaluation
- Privacy-preserving AI deployment methodologies
- RAG optimization for curriculum coherence

**Educational Research**:

- Metrics for pedagogical effectiveness in AI tutoring
- Mixed-methods approach to AI education evaluation
- Scalable assessment frameworks for multilingual contexts

### Immediate Next Steps for Application Development

1. **Develop Compelling Research Questions** aligned with Spencer priorities:
   - How does local LLM deployment affect pedagogical quality vs. cloud-based alternatives?
   - What cultural context integration strategies optimize language learning outcomes?
   - How can privacy-preserving AI enhance rather than limit educational effectiveness?

2. **Strengthen Collaborative Network**:
   - Identify language education partners for pilot studies
   - Engage with AI education researchers for methodological validation
   - Connect with policy researchers for implementation analysis

3. **Prepare Preliminary Data**:
   - Baseline assessments of current language learning tools
   - Initial technical feasibility demonstrations
   - Literature review positioning within AI education research

4. **Develop Evaluation Framework**:
   - Pre/post learning outcome measures
   - Cultural sensitivity assessment protocols
   - Technical performance benchmarks
   - Cost-effectiveness analysis for institutional adoption

### Conclusion

The ITS4LL project strongly aligns with Spencer's vision for culturally relevant, pedagogically-grounded AI education tools, with significant potential for methodological contribution and practical impact in language learning contexts.
