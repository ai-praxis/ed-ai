## Private Foundation Sources

### Spencer Foundation 

#### AI and Education Initiative

- **Program**: New major initiative launched 2024
- **Focus**: Equitable educational AI development and understanding
- **Grant Types**: 
  - Vision Grants: Up to $75,000 (12 months)
  - Large Research Grants: $125,000-$500,000 (1-5 years)
  - Small Research Grants: Up to $50,000 (1-5 years)
- **Relevance**: Perfect alignment with AI tutoring systems
- **Priority**: Equity and reducing digital divide
- **Website**: https://www.spencer.org/initiative-on-ai-and-education

Note: 

The "AI and Learning" initiative seems like a very good fit here is the description: 

> How can AI tools be more culturally relevant, and how can we leverage recent advances in learning sciences to build more sophisticated tools for classrooms that are in line with what we know from cognitive science and learning sciences to better serve all students? In PK-12 this might include tool and program development, but also studying existing products, and the pedagogical issues around teaching and learning with AI tools. In higher education, this might include learning products but also supports for student services, course enrollment and management, and advising supports. This may also take the form of historical or philosophical inquiry into the theories of learning of AI and how these theories could be adapted to align with culturally relevant pedagogy and other advances in the learning sciences. Finally, in what ways might AI technologies be leveraged outside of school to enable learning for children and adults?

Here is a [link](https://www.spencer.org/research-grants) to the Spencer Foundation's research grants page, which includes the AI and Education initiative. There are a number of different grant types available, but the "Research Grants on Education: small" grant type seems like the most relevant for ITS4LL, with a maximum of $50,000 for 1-5 years.
