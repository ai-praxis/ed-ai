# AI in Higher Education Research Hub

> A central repository for research, literature, and resources on AI interventions in higher education

## Overview

This repository serves as the **hub** for the AI-PRAXIS organization's research on artificial intelligence applications in higher education. It provides a centralized location for:

- Literature reviews and annotated bibliographies on AI in education
- Research notes and conceptual frameworks
- Funding strategies and grant opportunities
- Reusable templates and resources for research projects

## Philosophy

Rather than replacing existing educational infrastructure, we focus on **AI interventions that enhance and empower** current practices. Our approach emphasizes:

- Micro-interventions that support students and educators
- Ethical AI integration aligned with educational missions
- Institutional agency over AI tools and services
- Evidence-based design grounded in educational research

## Hub-and-Spoke Model

This repository follows a **hub-and-spoke architecture**:

- **Hub (this repo)**: General AI-in-education knowledge, literature, and resources
- **Spokes**: Project-specific repositories that build on hub foundations

### Current Spoke Projects

- `ed-ai-its`: Intelligent tutoring systems for language learning
- `ed-ai-session-prep`: AI-assisted preparation for tutoring sessions
- More to come...

Each spoke inherits the hub structure but adds project-specific work under `./project/`.
