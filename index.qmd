title: "ed-ai: AI in Higher Education Research Hub"
subtitle: "Advancing AI interventions that enhance educational practice"
---

## Welcome

This is the central hub for research and development on artificial intelligence applications in higher education. Our mission is to explore, document, and develop AI interventions that **enhance rather than replace** existing educational infrastructure.

## Our Approach

We believe that AI in education should:

- **Empower institutions** to maintain agency over their educational mission
- **Support students and educators** through thoughtful micro-interventions
- **Build on existing infrastructure** rather than disrupting proven practices
- **Ground design in research** from educational theory and practice

## What You'll Find Here

### Research & Literature

Comprehensive reviews and annotated bibliographies covering:

- AI applications in higher education
- Intelligent tutoring systems
- Large language models in educational contexts
- Educational technology and learning sciences

### Funding Resources

Strategies and opportunities for securing funding:

- Grant programs focused on AI in education
