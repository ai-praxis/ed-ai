## LLM tutoring system design 


### Challenges 

#### Fairness/ inclusivity 

- LLMs are trained on data that may not be representative of all groups, leading to potential biases in responses.
- Social stereotypes and biases can be perpetuated by LLMs, affecting the quality of tutoring for marginalized groups.

- [ ] This is an ongoing issue in AI research, and there are no easy solutions. 

#### Reliability/ safety 

- LLMs can generate incorrect or misleading information, which can be harmful in an educational context ("hallucinations"). 
- Inconsistencies may arise in responses, leading to confusion for learners or misalignment with educational goals. 

- [ ] Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can help mitigate: 
  - hallucinations by grounding responses in reliable sources,
  - inconsistencies by providing a consistent context for responses.
