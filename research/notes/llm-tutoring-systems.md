# Research on Local vs. Cloud LLMs for Tutoring

## Core Research Idea

Exploring the use of **local fine-tuned LLMs** as tutoring agents in educational settings, focusing on:

- **Data privacy & security**
- **Pedagogical alignment**
- **Comparative effectiveness** against cloud-based LLMs with system-level prompt controls

## Key Research Questions

1. Can local LLMs be more pedagogically aligned and trustworthy for universities compared to cloud-based models?
2. Does fine-tuning a local model improve educational value over prompt-only approaches?
3. What additional benefits arise from incorporating **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** into a local model?
4. How do these setups compare in terms of:
   - Controllability
   - Content alignment
   - Academic integrity
   - Feasibility and cost

## Proposed Studies (Initial Framework)

| Study | Description | Focus |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Study 1** | Compare **local LLM vs. cloud LLM** using system prompts only | Baseline performance and controllability |
| **Study 2** | Fine-tune the local LLM with general or course-specific data | Improvements in alignment and relevance |
| **Study 3** | Add **RAG** to the local model using institution-licensed materials | Dynamic, context-rich responses with secure access |
| *(Optional Study 4)* | Apply RAG in the **cloud** and evaluate copyright concerns & performance | Scalability vs. licensing/copyright complexity |

## Feasibility and Evaluation Approaches

### Short-term

- Student feedback surveys
- Micro-assessments or task-based performance metrics

### Long-term

- Learning outcomes and course performance
- Institutional adoption perspectives (e.g., IT, ethics committees)

## Discussion on Combining Studies

### Recommended Combination Paths

- **Study 1 + Study 2**: Demonstrates improvement from fine-tuning over prompting alone. Simple and internally consistent.

- **Study 1 + Study 3**: Shows enhancement from adding RAG to a base local model. Requires more infrastructure, but compelling.

### Full Progressive Design (Optional)

A 3-tier enhancement path for local models:

1. Prompt-only
2. Fine-tuned
3. Fine-tuned + RAG

This structure enables incremental reporting and multiple publication paths.

## Overall Research Value

This research is:

- **Timely** – aligns with interest in AI for education.
- **Practical** – addresses implementation and governance.
- **Modular** – supports phased evaluations and publishing.
