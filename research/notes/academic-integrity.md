# Academic Integrity in the Age of AI

## Introduction

Academic integrity is a cornerstone of higher education, ensuring that students' work is their own and that they are evaluated fairly on their own merits. The advent of generative AI has raised new questions and challenges about how to maintain academic integrity in educational contexts.

## Key Perspectives

### Has AI Changed the Landscape?

- [Academic Integrity in the Age of AI, James Lang "Cheating Lessons"](https://tophat-1.wistia.com/medias/gw9x4qbe7l) provides an overview of challenges and opportunities that AI presents for academic integrity.

**Lang's Argument**: Cheating has been constant throughout history, and AI has not fundamentally changed the landscape of academic integrity. The real issue is student engagement. He suggests that instructors have the responsibility to create engaging assignments that students will not want to cheat on.

**Critical Perspective**: While engagement is important, this view may underestimate:

- The unprecedented accessibility and capability of AI tools compared to historical forms of assistance
- The challenge of distinguishing AI-generated work from student work
- The need for institutional policies and technological approaches alongside pedagogical strategies
- The ethical dimensions of AI use that go beyond simple "cheating" frameworks

## Implications for Educational AI Design

When designing AI interventions in education, consider:

1. **Transparency**: Make expectations about AI use clear in learning contexts
2. **Attribution**: Develop norms for acknowledging AI assistance
3. **Assessment design**: Create assignments that value process, critical thinking, and authentic application
4. **AI literacy**: Teach students about appropriate and ethical AI use
5. **Integration vs. prohibition**: Consider how to productively integrate AI tools rather than simply banning them

## Institutional Responses

Universities are taking various approaches:

- Developing AI use policies for courses and assignments
- Investing in detection technologies (with mixed effectiveness)
- Redesigning assessments to emphasize process and in-class work
- Creating honor code frameworks that address AI use
- Offering professional development for faculty on AI and assessment

## Open Questions

- How do we define "original work" in an AI-augmented world?
- What level of AI assistance is appropriate at different educational levels?
- How can we assess learning when AI can generate sophisticated outputs?
- What role should AI literacy play in curriculum design?
- How do we balance access to AI tools with maintaining fairness?
