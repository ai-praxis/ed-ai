**Adaptation Notes**:

This template is designed for AI-in-education research projects. Key considerations:

1. **AI System Transparency**: Clearly explain how the AI system works in lay terms
2. **Data Privacy**: Be explicit about whether external AI services are used
3. **Academic Integrity**: Address concerns about AI assistance and assessment
4. **Institutional Control**: Clarify institutional oversight of AI systems
5. **Bias and Fairness**: Address potential algorithmic bias concerns
6. **Withdrawal**: Ensure participants can opt out without academic penalty

For specific IRB requirements, consult your institution's research compliance office.
